Code Standards
--------------
Forte2 uses the `functional composition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science)>`_ style (like the `TensorFlow functional API <https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional_api>`_) for most quantum chemical methods, with the following programmatic flow:

>>> rhf = forte2.scf.RHF(charge=0)(system)
>>> ci = forte2.ci.CI(states=state, active_orbitals=[...], ...)(rhf)
>>> ci.run()
-0.75102385

This means that most methods should be a class with a ``__call__`` method that takes the previous method as an argument, and returns a new instance. Each method should also have a ``run`` method that executes the method and returns the result. This allows for easy chaining of methods, as shown in the example above.

If you create new C++ functions or classes that are exposed through nanobind, make sure to document them in the binding code (`forte2/api`), 
and run the `nanobind stubgen<https://nanobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/typing.html#command-line-interface>` in the root directory::

    python -m nanobind.stubgen -m forte2._forte2 -O forte2

This provides a "stub file" for (1) the RTD documentation, (2) autocomplete, argument hints, etc in IDEs like VSCode. Make sure to commit the stub file along with your other changes.

Style Guide
-----------
Forte2 uses ``Black Formatter`` for Python code and ``Clang-Format`` for C++ code. Both can be obtained in VSCode via the extensions marketplace or via the command line.

Docstrings should follow the `Numpy style guide <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_.
For example::
    class MagicFCI:
    r"""
    A class that runs the full configuration interaction in constant time.

    .. math::
        |\Psi\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i |\Phi_i\rangle

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : forte2.system.System
        The system to perform the configuration interaction on.
    ci_dim : int
        The dimension of the configuration interaction space.
    algorithm : string, optional, default="magic"
        The algorithm to use for the configuration interaction. Options are "magic", "brute_force", and "magic_brute_force".
    shift : float, optional
        The eigenvalue shift :math:`\eta` to use. If None, no shift is applied.

    Attributes
    ----------
    ci_vec : NDArray
        The configuration interaction vector.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The energy of the system after running the configuration interaction.

    Notes
    -----
    The "magic" algorithm follows the approach described in J. Magic Theory Comput., 1, 1324 (2036).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the provided system is not in the training set of OpenMol.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> fci = forte2.ci.MagicFCI(system, ci_dim=100, algorithm="magic", shift=0.1)(rhf)
    >>> fci.run()
    -42.0000000000
    """

A few notes on the docstring style (for more, see the Numpy style guide linked above):

- Classes should have a docstring directly after the class definition, and not under the ``__init__`` method.
- The first line should be a brief summary of the class or function.
- Display-style LaTeX equations can be included using the ``.. math::`` directive, note the indentation and newlines before and after the equation. If you use LaTeX, the docstring should be a raw string (i.e., prefixed with ``r"""``). Inline equations can be included like ``:math:\`\eta\```.
- The ``Parameters`` section should include all parameters (arguments for functions, init arguments for classes), their types, and whether they are optional, with default values if applicable. If the default value is ``None`` or other placeholder (*i.e.* not used as a value), then only ``optional`` is needed.
- The ``Attributes`` section should include public attributes of the class, their types, and a brief description.
- The return should have the type but not necessarily the name.
- Only public methods and functions *need* to be documented (all functions with a leading underscore, like ``_my_private_function`` are considered private), however private functions should still be well documented for clarity.
